I worked with two primary datasets:
1. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset
o Columns: Date, Classification (Fear/Greed
2. Historical Trader Data from Hyperliquid
o Columns include: account, symbol, execution price, size, side, time,

Your objective is to explore the relationship between trader performance and market 
sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver insights that can drive smarter trading 
strategies.
